<code>React</code> <code>HTML</code> <code>CSS</code> <code>JavaScript</code>

## <img src="blog-icon.png" alt="My Tech Blog logo" class="side-projects-icon" /> My Tech Blog

<code>HTML</code> <code>CSS</code> <code>JavaScript</code>

In early 2025, I took the plunge and started this blog.
I already had a personal wiki based on [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) which I created a long time back, but I wanted to create a different space to share my passions, expertise and thoughts.
A place where I can also track my journey and growth.
It isn't my first side project, but this one feels particularly meaningful for me.
