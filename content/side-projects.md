A collection of my side projects.

<code>Home Automation</code> <code>Python</code>

SG Bus Arrivals is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## <img src="pdf-datatable-icon.png" alt="PDF DataTable logo" class="side-projects-icon" /> PDF DataTable

<code>React</code> <code>HTML</code> <code>CSS</code> <code>JavaScript</code>

PDF DataTable is a productivity tool that I built to export PDFs to CSV files.
I used the React-PDF library to render PDFs to allow me to select elements so that I can quickly filter out relevant records to be exported.

## <img src="blog-icon.png" alt="My Tech Blog logo" class="side-projects-icon" /> My Tech Blog

<code>Static Site Generator</code> <code>HTML</code> <code>CSS</code> <code>JavaScript</code>

In early 2025, I took the plunge and started this blog.
I already had a personal wiki based on [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) which I created a long time back, but I wanted to create a different space to share my passions, expertise and thoughts.
A place where I can also track my journey and growth.
It isn't my first side project, but this one feels particularly meaningful for me.
