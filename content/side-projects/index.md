A collection of my side projects.
It's a little bare at the moment since I'm still in the midst of filling up this section.

## <img src="sg-bus-arrivals-icon.png" alt="SG Bus Arrivals logo" class="side-projects-icon" /> SG Bus Arrivals

<code>Home Automation</code> <code>Python</code>

SG Bus Arrivals is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
It uses the [LTA DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html) APIs to fetch data on public transport services.
The data can then be used in automations to display bus arrival times or trigger notifications based on geo-proximity or presence.

## <img src="pdf-datatable-icon.png" alt="PDF DataTable logo" class="side-projects-icon" /> PDF DataTable

<code>React</code> <code>HTML</code> <code>CSS</code> <code>JavaScript</code>

PDF DataTable is a productivity tool that I built to export PDFs to CSV files.
I used the React-PDF library to render PDFs to allow me to select elements so that I can quickly filter out relevant records to be exported.

## <img src="blog-icon.png" alt="My Tech Blog logo" class="side-projects-icon" /> My Tech Blog

<code>HTML</code> <code>CSS</code> <code>JavaScript</code>

In early 2025, I took the plunge and started this blog.
I already had a personal wiki based on [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) which I created a long time back, but I wanted to create a different space to share my passions, expertise and thoughts.
A place where I can also track my journey and growth.
It isn't my first side project, but this one feels particularly meaningful for me.
