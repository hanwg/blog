Boost your Java development productivity with Lombok! 🚀

**𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘁?**

Lombok is a Java library which auto generates boilerplate code through the use of annotations.
It can generate code for getters/setters, `𝚎𝚚𝚞𝚊𝚕𝚜()`, `𝚑𝚊𝚜𝚑𝙲𝚘𝚍𝚎()`, `𝚝𝚘𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐()` and even constructors/builders.

**𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝘁?**

It eliminates boilerplate code which leads to...
- Improve readability since there is less clutter and also makes pull requests easier to review.
- Increased productivity and frees up your time to focus on core business logic.

**An example**

No Lombok:
```java
public class User {
  private String name;
  
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    // hashCode implementation
  }
  
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    // equals implementation
  }
  
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "name: " + name;
  }
}
```

With Lombok:
```java
@Data
public class User {
  private String name;
}
```
- All the boilerplate code is replaced with just a `@Data` annotation.
- If you need to add new attributes, you don't need to change the `equals()`, `hashCode()` and `toString()` methods as Lombok will handle them for you!
