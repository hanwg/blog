Happy new year and hello 2026!
As the new year begins, I am taking some time to look back and reflect on 2025.

## Highlights

My proud moments:
- **Contributed to an open source project.** After a series of impactful contributions, I was formally recognized as a code owner for the [Home Assistant Telegram bot integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/telegram_bot/).
  Moving from a user to contributor and finally to code owner has been an incredible journey for me.
  There's no better feeling than seeing my work having an impact on the community!
- **Achieved Super Contributor in Hacktoberfest.** Hacktoberfest was challenging for me as the event had a short time frame (within the month of October).
  However, I persevered and archived the **Super Contributor** status by consistently delivered quality Pull Requests (PRs) with features, code quality improvements, bug fixes, tests / code coverage, and documentation.

## Learning and Development

Every year, I dedicate a significant amount of time for skill development and 2025 is no different.
For the past year, my focus is on **Cloud infrastructure**.

After a few years of hands-on experience developing scalable and secure cloud-native apps on AWS, I decided it was time for me to get certified.

More recently, I've also expanded my experience to include <abbr title="Oracle Cloud Infrastructure">OCI</abbr> through the course of my work.
With an existing strong foundation in AWS cloud, I was able to accelerate my learning of OCI technologies and achieved the certifications required for my role.

Armed with this knowledge, I am confident that I will be able to develop and support complex systems in a multi-cloud / hybrid cloud environment.
