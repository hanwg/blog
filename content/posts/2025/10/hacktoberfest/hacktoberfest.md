It's October, and that means 1 thing for the open source community: **Hacktoberfest**!
This year is my first participation, and I'm eager to complete the ultimate challenge: to become a **Super Contributor üèÜ**.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

For those unfamiliar, Hacktoberfest is a month-long event organized annually by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/open-source/hacktoberfest) to encourage everyone (coders and non-coders) to contribute to open source.
Much of the modern tech stack rely heavily on open source projects and this event is about giving back to these projects through learning and collaboration.

## Participating in Hacktoberfest

Want to join Hacktoberfest too?
You'll need a basic working knowledge of **Git**.
The folks at DigitalOcean has provided a handy [Git reference guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/cheatsheets/how-to-use-git-a-reference-guide) if you need a refresher.

Participation is simple:
1. Sign-up for Hacktoberfest at https://hacktoberfest.com/.
2. Submit a Pull Request (PR) to a [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/topics/hacktoberfest) hosted project.
3. Earn a digital badge when your first PR is accepted (i.e. approved and merged into the main branch) by the project's maintainers.
4. Level-up your badge for each additional accepted PR.
5. Achieve the **Super Contributor** status when you have **at least 6 accepted PRs**.

## My Hacktoberfest Contributions

I'm a regular contributor to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) (you can learn more about that here: [My Open Source Development Journey: From User to Code Owner](/posts/2025/07/open-source-journey)) so I was excited when I learned that it is a Hacktoberfest participating project.

I have been busy with my career transition recently (I left my banking job to join Big Tech) and there was a number of improvements and issues which have been lingering in my mind for a while.
After a short planning session, I was ready to start work on my PRs:
1. Adding tests to improve code coverage. 
2. A number of code quality improvements.
3. Updating documentation.
4. Updating icons to make them compatible with dark mode.

With a strong knowledge of the project's contribution guidelines and codebase, I was able to complete my PRs earlier than I had planned.
By the 2nd week of October, I had managed to accumulate 6 accepted PRs.
After a brief period of waiting, I was finally awarded the Super Contributor badge:
|                                                 |                                                                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Super Contributor](../super-contributor.webp) | *Thanks to the Home Assistant community who helped with the PRs!*<br/><br/>Here's my [GitHub Activity for October 2025](https://github.com/hanwg?tab=overview&from=2025-10-01&to=2025-10-31) that helped me earn the badge!<br/><br/>Stats:<br/>Submitted 22 PRs across 4 repositories.<br/>Reviewed 10 PRs across 2 repositories. |

Now that I've reached my Hacktoberfest goal, I'm back to working on feature enhancements, some of which have been in-progress even before Hacktoberfest began. These are much larger in scope and typically take a few weeks or even months to complete.

## Addendum: A Contribution Guide

Itching to start contributing? Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Find a project.** Search for actively maintained projects with issues labelled `good first issue` or `hacktoberfest`. To minimize the learning curve, you might want to narrow down your search to projects that uses a tech stack that you are familiar with. *This is the most challenging step. Find a project that you are passionate about and it won't feel like a chore.*
2. **Review the project's contribution guidelines.** Study the project's `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` or Wiki to understand the project's coding style, naming conventions and PR submission processes to ensure that your PR meets the project's standards to avoid unnecessary rework.
3. **Fork the project's repository** to create a new independent copy of the project's repository under your account.
4. **Clone your fork** to create a local copy of your fork on your machine.
5. **Add an upstream to the original project** to allow you to pull updates from the original repository into your fork and also submit PRs.
6. **Develop and commit your changes.** Use clear and descriptive commit messages to provide the context of the change.
7. **Push your changes** to sync your commits from your machine to GitHub.
8. **Create a new PR.** Go to your fork in GitHub and create the PR. Ensure that your PR description explains the changes (e.g. the what-why-how) to help maintainers with the review.
9. **Wait for your PR to be reviewed.** Patience is important here as maintainers typically have other PRs to review too.
