Whether you are a sysadmin, cybersecurity professional, software engineer or just someone who is passionate about technology, a home lab is a personal playground for learning, experimenting and building technical skills.
But how should one start?

Let's dive into the hardware essentials that form the backbone of a home lab.

## Compute

The first hardware that you will need is a machine that runs your home lab.
We have the following options:

### 1. Small Form Factor (SFF) PC

SFF PCs are best choice for starting a home lab:
- **Footprint.** They are tiny and ideal for homes where space might be a constraint.
- **Cost.** Their low cost makes it affordable for creating clusters without burning a hole in your pocket.
- **Performance.** While the least powerful of all options, their performance is adequate for most home labs or even supporting a small group of users for everyday tasks.
- **Upgradability.** Upgradability is often limited since components are typically soldered directly to the motherboard. However, with proper planning, your hardware should easily serve the needs of your home lab for the next couple of years. 

Examples: Raspberry Pi, Mini PCs

### 2. Desktop PC



### 3. Enterprise-grade Servers

Examples: HP Proliant, Dell Poweredge

## Networking

## Storage
