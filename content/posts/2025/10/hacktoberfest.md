It's October, and that means 1 thing for the open source community: **Hacktoberfest**!
This year is my first participation, and I'm eager to complete the ultimate challenge: to be become a **üèÜ Super Contributor**.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

For those unfamiliar, Hacktoberfest is a month-long event organized annually by DigitalOcean to encourage everyone (coders and non-coders) to contribute to open source.
Much of the modern tech stack rely heavily on open source projects and this event is about giving back to these projects through learning and collaboration.

## Participating in Hacktoberfest

Want to join Hacktoberfest too?
Well, you will need basic working knowledge of **Git**.
The folks at DigitalOcean has provided a handy [Git reference guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/cheatsheets/how-to-use-git-a-reference-guide) if you need a refresher.

Participation is simple:
1. Sign-up for Hacktoberfest at https://hacktoberfest.com/.
2. Submit a Pull Request (PR) to a [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/topics/hacktoberfest) hosted project.
3. Earn a digital badge when your first PR is accepted (i.e. approved and merged into the main branch) by the project's maintainers.
4. Level-up your badge for each additional accepted PR.
5. Achieve the **Super Contributor** status when you have **at least 6 accepted PRs**.

## My Hacktoberfest Contributions

I am a regular contributor to various [Home Assistant repositories](https://github.com/home-assistant) (you can learn more about that here: [My Open Source Development Journey: From User to Code Owner](/posts/2025/07/open-source-journey)) so I was excited when I learned that [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is a Hacktoberfest participating project.

I have been busy with my career transition recently (I left my banking job to join Big Tech) and there was a number of improvements and issues which have been lingering in my mind for a while.
After a short planning session, I was ready to start work on my PRs:
1. Adding tests to improve code coverage. 
2. A number of code quality improvements.
3. Updating documentation.
4. Updating icons to make them compatible with dark mode.

With a strong knowledge of the project's contribution guidelines and codebase, I was able to complete my PRs earlier than I had planned.
By the 2nd week of October, I had managed to accumulate 6 accepted PRs.

Now that I've reached my Hacktoberfest goal, I'm back to working on feature enhancements, some of which have been in-progress even before Hacktoberfest began. These are much larger in scope and typically take a few weeks or even months to complete.
