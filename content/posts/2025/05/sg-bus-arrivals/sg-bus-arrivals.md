As a home automation enthusiast, the 1 thing that I always wanted to automate is keeping track of bus arrivals.
Wouldn't it be great to glance at a dashboard or receive notifications to know exactly when the bus is arriving?
That's why I built [SG Bus Arrivals](https://github.com/hanwg/sg-bus-arrivals), a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

Today, I will be sharing my journey of building SG Bus Arrivals.

## Early Beginnings

When I first moved to my new house in 2023, bus services were few and far in between.
Missing a bus would mean waiting for at least 20-30 minutes for the next bus.
There were already transport apps such as [MyTransport.SG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.lta.mytransportsg), but I wanted to have a more seamless experience than launching an app and navigating through menus.  

Hence, I set out to develop an automation to send notification for bus arrivals when I'm about to leave my home.
Thankfully, LTA provides access to a wealth of public transport data, including real-time bus arrivals via the [LTA DataMall Public Transport API](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html#Public%20Transport).

My first implementation was a No Code solution based on YAML-configuration.
The configuration defines the REST API call that would fetch me the bus arrival times. 

Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`:
```
rest_command:
  get_bus_arrivals:
    url: 'https://datamall2.mytransport.sg/ltaodataservice/v3/BusArrival?ServiceNo={{serviceNo}}&BusStopCode={{busStopCode}}'
    method: GET
    headers:
        accept: application/json
        AccountKey: !secret account_key
```

While it did work, it was clunky and had no error handling or flow control.
Moreover, my automations were cluttered with service invocations and parsing of HTTP responses. 

## The Goal: Bus Arrival Sensors

The next evolution was to build an integration which exposes bus arrival information as sensors in Home Assistant.
This enables easy monitoring using dashboards and simplified automations.

## Building the Integration Piece-by-Piece

Note: Some Home Assistant specific terminologies are used henceforth

Here's a quick overview of functionalities that I built for the integration:

### Integration Logo

I used Gen AI to generate the base logo.
Next, I did a little touch-up using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to remove noise and change color palettes to match the colors used by buses and bus stops in Singapore.

The final step is to create a pull request (PR) to submit my logos to the [Home Assistant Brands](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands) GitHub repository.
It takes a long time to get approval, so I continued with the development of my integration while waiting for my PR to be merged.

Here's the logo:<br/>

### LTA DataMall Client

I built a REST API consumer client for invoking the LTA DataMall APIs based on the [LTA DataMall API User Guide](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/datamall/datasets/LTA_DataMall_API_User_Guide.pdf).

(If you don't have an account key, you will need to [request for API access](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/request-for-api.html).
The account key is required to authenticate with the API.)

The relevant APIs implemented were the bus arrival information, bus routes and bus stop details.

### UI-based Configuration

I created a **config flow** to allow the user to configure authentication for the LTA DataMall API.
I also created a **subentry flow** for creating the sensors based on the bus stop and bus service number.

### Data Update Coordinator

The data update coordinator is a component of the integration responsible for using the LTA DataMall client to poll for bus arrival details and providing the data to the sensors. 

### Sensors

Sensors are entities which displays the bus arrival details such as estimated arrival times, bus type (Single Deck / Double Deck), etc.

I also used dynamic icons which changes based on the sensor state.
For example, if the bus is wheelchair accessible, the sensor will have a wheelchair icon.

I then linked the sensors to their respective **subentry** so that they can be easily managed as a group.

### Services

I exposed a service which requests the **coordinator** to refresh sensor data.
Usually, this isn't required since the **coordinator** will fetch the data at regular intervals.
For folks who don't like interval polling, this is an alternative which provides full control of when the update happens.

### Translations

Singapore is a multilingual society, and it would benefit the integration to have all the main languages (English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil) supported.
Besides, it doesn't take a lot of effort since Home Assistant already has a translation framework.

I only included English translations since I am focusing on the core functionalities of the integration.

## Integration Showcase

Here are some of the screenshots from the integration and how I have used it.

### Dashboard

I plan to mount a cheap tablet near the main door of my house so that I can glance at the bus arrivals.
Do I have time for a coffee or should I be running for the bus stop? This magic crystal ball will have the answers. 

Sample dashboard:

### Automation

Send / update push notification of bus arrivals when I leave home or when I am at a specific bus stops.
No more fiddling with apps!

## Conclusion

Building SG Bus Arrivals has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
It's a practical addition to my smart home and I hope others will find it useful too!
