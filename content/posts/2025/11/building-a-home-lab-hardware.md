Whether you are a sysadmin, cybersecurity professional, software engineer or just someone who is passionate about technology, a home lab is a personal playground for learning, experimenting and building technical skills.

Many people, including myself, also use it for self-hosting apps and services for family and friends.

But how should you start building one?
Let's dive into the hardware essentials that form the backbone of a home lab.

## Compute

The first hardware that you will need is a machine that runs your home lab.
We have the following options:

### 1. Small Form Factor (SFF) PC

Examples: Raspberry Pi, Mini PCs

SFF PCs is my preferred choice for starting a home lab:
- **Footprint.** They are tiny and ideal for homes where space might be a constraint.
- **Cost.** Their low cost makes it affordable for creating clusters without burning a hole in your pocket.
- **Performance.** While the least powerful of all options, their performance is adequate for most home labs or even supporting a small group of users for everyday tasks.
- **Upgradability.** Upgradability is often limited since components are typically soldered directly to the motherboard. However, with proper planning, your hardware should easily serve the needs of your home lab for the next couple of years.

### 2. Desktop PC

Desktop PCs are a popular choice for starting out especially if you already have an existing desktop.
You can experiment before commiting to the investment of dedicated hardware.

- **Footprint.** Fits nicely on most desks.
- **Cost.** Although desktop PCs are more expensive than SFF PCs, it is still affordable. You can also opt to repurpose an existing desktop to avoid additional costs.
- **Performance.** Desktop PCs have a wide range of performance depending on your build.
- **Upgradability.** Desktop PCs are modular with multiple expansion slots which allows you to scale as your home lab grows.

### 3. Enterprise-grade Servers

Examples: HP Proliant, Dell PowerEdge
