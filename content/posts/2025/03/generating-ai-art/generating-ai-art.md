It's a long weekend, and I was bored, so I generated some random AI art to entertain myself.
I used ComfyUI and ran some small models on my PC.

You might be wondering why not use ChatGPT / Co-Pilot / Gemini? Here's why:
- It's free and there are no queues since you are generating the images on your own hardware.
- You are not limited to specific image sizes or aspect ratios.
- You are not limited to text-to-image prompts. You can generate image-to-image and even videos too.
- You can use a wide variety of models. There are models which are good at generating photo-realistic images, models good at anime style images, etc.

Here are some samples that I generated:
|                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                            |

ComfyUI can be intimidating to new users, so I wrote a quickstart guide here: [ComfyUI Quickstart](../../comfyui-quickstart/comfyui-quickstart)
