I've created a new personal website: https://hanwg.top  

My mentor/coach said I should I should have a presence online so here it is.
It's quite barren at the moment since I only started posting a few days ago but
hopefully it will be filled with tech stories after a few years.

I didn't use any of the mainstream platforms such as Medium or WordPress since ads suck and I don't want to pay for any subscription. Hence, I created my site using the following free tools:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - for hosting static web content.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a static site generator which transform markdown files into web pages.

Skills needed:
- Markdown - for authoring content.
- Git - for pushing your content to GitHub Pages.

Time needed: a few hours

You can do it too.
