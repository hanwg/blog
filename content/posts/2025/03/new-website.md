I've created a new personal website: https://hanwg.top  

My mentor/coach said I should I should have a presence online so here it is.
It's quite barren at the moment since I only started posting a few days ago but
hopefully it will be filled with tech stories after a few years.

I didn't use any of the mainstream platforms such as Medium or WordPress since ads suck and I don't want to pay for any subscription. Hence, I created my site using the following free tools:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - for hosting static web content.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a static site generator which transforms markdown files into web pages.

I won't write a tutorial since there are already many guides out there but here's the gist of it (I'm using Hugo here but you can use any static site generator):
1) Install Hugo and Git on your PC.
2) Create a new GitHub public repository.
3) Note down your new website's URL in the GitHub repository settings.
4) Create a new GitHub Action to build your site (Refer to Hugo documentation).
5) Use Hugo to create a new site.
6) Create new markdown (.md) files containing your content. It's a blog post for me but it can be anything.
7) Git push your changes to your GitHub repository.
8) Wait for GitHub Action to finish building your site.

Repeat steps 6 and 8 whenever you want to publish new content.

Skills needed:
- Markdown - for authoring content.
- Git - for pushing your content to GitHub Pages.

Time needed: a few hours

You can do it too.
