# About Me

I'm a combination of software architect, developer and systems engineer.
Throughout my career of more than 15 years, I've designed software systems, written code in various programming languages and maintained IT infrastructures.
Like everyone else, I started with basic programming skills that I learnt in school.
With an inquisitive mind and a keen interest in technology, I started working on personal projects to help me develop my skills.
This blog serves as journal of my learning experiences.
