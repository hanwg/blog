I did the certifications because I wanted to validate my skills after working on projects on AWS for a number of years.\nI passed the exams in a single attempt within a month and would like to share some tips:\nLots of hands-on experience - Throughout the course of my work, I had to use a broad range of AWS services to deliver my projects. This helped me understand each service well and how various services work together (i.e. the architectural aspect). Such knowledge simply can\u0026rsquo;t be gleaned from rote memorization of documentation. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to get your hands dirty and try to build a system.\nTraining - I used Stephane\u0026rsquo;s course in Udemy. His course helped to reinforce what I already know and also filled gaps in my knowledge especially lesser known AWS services. Having a skilled trainer can also help to reduce the prep time by focusing on the more important topics in the exam.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a recurring theme - The first exam I took was the Solutions Architect Professional and it was really hard. The subsequent exams was a lot easier since there was overlapping content and I noticed that there\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;pattern\u0026rdquo; across the exams - the correct answer usually has some elements of cost optimization, automation, operational efficiency involved.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it.
