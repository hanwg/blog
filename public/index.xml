      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new personal website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hanwg.top&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;https://hanwg.top&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mentor/coach said I should I should have a presence online so here it is.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite barren at the moment since I only started posting a few days ago but
hopefully it will be filled with tech stories after a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t use any of the mainstram blog sites such as medium or WordPress since ads suck and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for any subscription. Hence, I created my site using the following free tools:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I&#39;ve got my AWS certifications ðŸ˜†</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m overjoyed that I&amp;rsquo;ve obtained the Amazon Web Services (AWS) DevOps Professional, Solutions Architect Professional and Security Specialty certifications.
I did the certifications because I wanted to validate my skills after working on projects on AWS for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed the exams in a single attempt within a month and would like to share some tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of hands-on experience - Throughout the course of my work, I had to use a broad range of AWS services to deliver my projects. This helped me understand each service well and how various services work together (i.e. the architectural aspect). Such knowledge simply can&amp;rsquo;t be gleaned from rote memorization of documentation. You&amp;rsquo;ve got to get your hands dirty and try to build a system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a combination of software architect, developer and systems engineer.
Throughout my career of more than 15 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve designed software systems, written code in various programming languages and maintained IT infrastructures.
Like everyone else, I started with basic progamming skills that I learnt in school.
With an inquisitive mind and a keen interest in technology, I started working on personal projects to help me develop my skills.
This blog serves as journal of my learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
